          Using Next js, Chakra-UI and Formik to build CRUD

          This application is featured with create,read,update and delete (CRUD)
          operations implemented using Formik for handling forms,NextJS as React framework 
          and Chakra-UI to polish the designs.The server side codes are quite easy to
          understand as NextJS is featured with SSR.I didn&apos;t use the realtime database (
          I&apos;m treating <strong>db.json</strong> file as database here)like one of MongoDB or MySQL but the code implementation works exactly
          like how we can connect our front-end part with the realtime backend.Don&apos;t
          forget to give me a star if you liked the app ðŸ˜Š.
